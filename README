Pachube Ethernet Switch
-----------------------

Simple relay ethernet switcher using Pachube. It includes Watchdog and manual reset to Arduino. The sketch listens for a Pachube datastream to change value and then switches between 1 (on) and 0(off) on the local sketch, it also includes a state machine so it doesn't try to switch the same device on twice. It can be used with a set of relays for remote control of devices.


Configuration:
---------------

1. Create a feed at  www.pachube.com with one datastream for each device that will be controlled. 

2. Configure it with Pachube:

#define REMOTEFEED     8686 //remote feed number here, this has to be your own feed
#define LOCALFEED      7873 //local feed number here
#define APIKEY         "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" // enter your pachube api key here

3. On a breadboard, connect two LED's in the pins indicated below each device you want to control.

int device0_pin1 = 7;  // on
int device0_pin2 = 6;  // off

int device1_pin1 = 5; // on              
int device1_pin2 = 4; // off

int device2_pin1 = 3; // on               
int device2_pin2 = 2; // off

4. To test your system use a CURL request to change the datastream values in Pachube to 0 and 1. You will see the On and Off leds blink once.

5. Then it's up to you, you can connect this to a series of relays and start triggering low powered stuff.
